## 🌐 New Domain Configuration

**Primary Domain:** my.doctorhealthy1.com

**SSL Certificate:** Let's Encrypt (automatic)
**CORS Allowed Origin:** https://my.doctorhealthy1.com

## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

### 1. **Rebuild Application** (Updated CORS)
Since main.go was updated with the new domain, you need to rebuild:

```bash
cd /Users/khaledahmedmohamed/Desktop/pure\ nutrition\ cursor\ or\ kiro
go build -o main .
```

### 2. **Follow Configuration Steps**
Open `COOLIFY-MANUAL-STEPS.md` and complete the 3 steps:
- Environment Variables (use updated `coolify-env-vars.txt`)
- Domain & SSL (use `my.doctorhealthy1.com`)
- Persistent Storage

### 3. **Deploy to Coolify**
After configuration, deploy your application with the updated CORS settings.
