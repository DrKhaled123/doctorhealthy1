# Git Automation Setup

This project now includes comprehensive Git automation that eliminates the need to manually commit and push changes. The automation includes auto-save, auto-formatting, pre-commit hooks, post-commit hooks, and convenient command-line tools.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Automatic Operations
- **Auto-save**: Files are automatically saved after 1 second of inactivity
- **Auto-format**: Code is automatically formatted on save
- **Auto-commit**: Changes are automatically committed with pre-commit hooks
- **Auto-push**: Successful commits are automatically pushed to the remote repository
- **Auto-sync**: Easy synchronization with remote repositories

### 🛠️ Quality Assurance
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run linting, type checking, tests, and security scans before each commit
- **Code formatting**: Automatic formatting with ESLint and Prettier
- **Import organization**: Automatic import sorting and organization
- **File associations**: Proper syntax highlighting for all file types

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Setup Script

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-automation.sh
```

This script will:
- Add the `git-auto` alias to your shell configuration
- Create a symlink in `~/.local/bin/` for global access
- Set up the necessary PATH configurations

### 2. Restart Your Terminal

After running the setup script, restart your terminal or source your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc if using zsh
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Check that the automation is working:

```bash
git-auto status
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Quick Commands

Once set up, you have access to these convenient commands:

#### `git-auto commit "message"`
Auto-commit all changes and push to remote:
```bash
git-auto commit "Add new feature implementation"
```

#### `git-auto quick [message]`
Quick commit with timestamp:
```bash
git-auto quick "WIP"
# Creates: "WIP - 2024-01-15 14:30:45"
```

#### `git-auto sync`
Sync with remote (pull and push):
```bash
git-auto sync
```

#### `git-auto status`
Show current git status:
```bash
git-auto status
```

#### `git-auto recent [count]`
Show recent commits:
```bash
git-auto recent 10
```

#### `git-auto backup`
Create a backup branch:
```bash
git-auto backup
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. VS Code Integration
- **Auto-save**: Files save automatically after 1 second
- **Format on save**: Code is formatted automatically
- **Code actions**: ESLint fixes and import organization run on save
- **Git integration**: Enhanced git features with auto-fetch and smart commit

### 2. Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`): Runs quality checks before commits
  - ESLint checking
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Test execution
  - Security scanning
  - Property-based testing

- **Post-commit hook** (`.husky/post-commit`): Automatically pushes to remote
  - Detects current branch
  - Pushes to `origin/main` for main branch
  - Provides feedback on push success/failure

### 3. Command-Line Tools
- **git-auto script**: Provides convenient commands for git operations
- **Shell integration**: Easy-to-use aliases and PATH setup
- **Colored output**: Clear success/error/warning messages

## 🎨 VS Code Settings

The automation includes these VS Code enhancements:

```json
{
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit",
    "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
  },
  "git.autofetch": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,
  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.postCommitCommand": "sync"
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Branch-Specific Behavior
- **Main branch**: Auto-pushes to `origin/main` after commits
- **Other branches**: Shows push command but doesn't auto-push (for safety)

### Error Handling
- If pre-commit hooks fail, the commit is aborted
- If auto-push fails, you'll see an error message with manual instructions
- All operations provide clear feedback on success/failure

### Safety Features
- Backup branch creation before major changes
- Comprehensive error messages and troubleshooting tips
- Non-destructive operations with rollback options

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"git-auto command not found"**
```bash
# Run the setup script again
./scripts/setup-git-automation.sh

# Or source your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

**"Auto-push failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify git remote configuration: `git remote -v`
- Ensure you have push permissions to the repository

**"Pre-commit hooks failing"**
- Fix any linting errors in your code
- Run tests manually: `npm run test`
- Check TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit`

### Manual Override

If you need to bypass automation temporarily:

```bash
# Commit without hooks
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"

# Push manually
git push origin main
```

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Zero-click workflow**: Save files and they're automatically committed and pushed
- **Quality assurance**: Automated testing and linting on every commit
- **Time savings**: No more manual git commands for routine operations
- **Consistency**: Standardized commit messages and formatting
- **Safety**: Backup options and error handling

## 📞 Support

The automation is designed to be robust and user-friendly. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the colored output messages for specific error details
3. Run `git-auto help` for command reference
4. Check git status: `git-auto status`

**Happy automating!** 🚀 Your git workflow is now hands-free and efficient.
